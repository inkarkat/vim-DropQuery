DESCRIPTION					       *DropQuery-description*

This plugin ...

HOW IT WORKS								     *

SOURCE									     *
(Original Vim tip, Stack Overflow answer, ...)

SEE ALSO								     *
(Plugins offering complementary functionality, or plugins using this library.)

RELATED WORKS								     *

- tcmdbar.vim (vimscript #1779) is a script for use with Total Commander's
  button bar by Andy Wokula

==============================================================================
USAGE							     *DropQuery-usage*
								       *:Drop*
:Drop[!] [++opt] [+cmd] {file} ...
			Automatically locate the visible {file}, use an empty
			window for it, or ask where to open {file}. With [!],
			always ask.
:{range}Drop[!] [++opt] [+cmd] [{glob} ...]
			Treat each line in {range} (stripped of leading and
			trailing whitespace) as a filespec / glob and ask
			where to open those. {glob} can be used to optionally
			filter the list.
:Drop[!] [++opt] [+cmd] {reg}
			Treat each line in {reg} (stripped of leading and
			trailing whitespace) as a filespec / glob and ask
			where to open those.

:[N]BufDrop[!] [N]	Automatically locate the visible buffer [N] / for
:BufDrop[!] {bufname}	{bufname}, use an empty window for it, or ask where to
			open it. With [!], or when the current buffer is
			specified, always ask.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					      *DropQuery-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-DropQuery
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim DropQuery*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					      *DropQuery-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.043 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					     *DropQuery-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						       *g:DropQuery_RemapDrop*
By default, the plugins remaps the built-in |:drop| command to use |:Drop|
instead. With this option, other integrations (e.g. VisVim) need not be
modified to use the DropQuery functionality. To turn this off, use: >
    let g:DropQuery_RemapDrop = 0
<							 *g:DropQuery_NoPopup*
The plugin uses a pop-up dialog in GVIM for the query. To use a textual query
(as is done in the console Vim) instead, use: >
    let g:DropQuery_NoPopup = 'default value'
This does not cover the :confirm query "Save changes to...?" when abandoning
modified buffers.
					      *g:DropQuery_MoveAwayPredicates*
To exempt certain windows from being the base window for the offered drop
actions, and therefore move away from them before querying for a drop action,
you can define predicate expressions or Funcrefs to characterize such windows
in the following List: >
    let g:DropQuery_MoveAwayPredicates = ["&filetype == 'scratch'"]
This is useful if you have any plugins that create vertical sidebars (e.g.
Tagbar), so you want to move to the (horizontally split) main window(s) first.

						*g:DropQuery_ExemptPredicates*
To exempt certain windows from being offered as targets for direct dropping
("Edit" / "View"), you can define predicate expressions or Funcrefs to
characterize such windows in the following List: >
    let g:DropQuery_ExemptPredicates = ['&buftype ==# "terminal"']
By default, the plugin moves away from |terminal-window|s, assuming you don't
want to replace a running session with an opened file.
					       *g:DropQuery_FilespecProcessor*
If you want to process individual filespecs passed to |:Drop|, you can hook in
a processor function that takes a single filespec (or file glob), and returns
this changed or unchanged: >
    function! MyFilespecProcessor( filespec )
	" Create virtual X drive mapping to C:\Windows.
	return substitute(a:filespec, '^X:', 'C:\Windows', '')
    endfunction
    let g:DropQuery_FilespecProcessor = function('MyFilespecProcessor')
